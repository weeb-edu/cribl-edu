Event Breakers

Event Breakers in Cribl Stream vs Cribl Search
 Cribl autoamtically parses event data into both of these products. The product does not provide state 0 data, that is to say, the data as it arrives into the product without any parsing into events.
 This makes sense from a performance and data manageability standpoint.
 Stream provides the ability to make change to event breakers which separate data stream into disparate events. This ability is called Event Breaking in Stream, or Datatypes in Search. 

 In Cribl Stream, and also in Search, we automatically apply best guess to the first 250 characters of an event. This can be adjusted under Advanced Settings > Max Timestamp Scan Depth.


Cribl uses AutoTimestamp in various forms to populate the following: (both as a function available to Pipelines OR as configured inside an Event Breaker)
   _time 
   _time is the result of AutoTimestamp, which is highly configurable. We recommend using UTC/GMT and converting to local time later in the data reporting layer.
